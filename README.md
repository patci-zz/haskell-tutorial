>"We don’t write
Haskell because we’re geniuses — we use tools like Haskell because we’re
not geniuses and it helps us. Good tools like Haskell enable us to work
faster, make fewer mistakes, and have more information about what our
code is supposed to do as we read it." - Christopher Allen & Julie Moronuki
